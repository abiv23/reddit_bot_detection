  "People way too concerned about being entertained every second of the game, so you want to remove strategy from it.",
  "My favorite power rankings headline this week was something like \"Cavs on fire...again\"\n\nWe're so good it's boring lol. I still appreciate whenever we get attention but I don't think the media is hating when they ignore us now. We're just not the most interesting narrative. I'm sure we'll get more attention in the playoffs",
  "MOBLEY! WHAT HAVE YA GOT?!  \n*Clutch 3*  \nOh...",
  "I found the pessimistic perd√≥n with unrealistic expectations¬†",
  "I also love how you lack basic reading comprehension in this entire thread. This thread started with someone saying he needed the money to pay legal bills because he abused women. An ignorant individual defended him (unaware he is an admitted abuser). And someone challenged that individual asking if we were pretending he did nothing wrong¬†\n\n\nBridges admitted in court to assaulting a woman. It is objective fact that he has paid legal fees as a result of multiple abuse allegations. And you are by definition ignorant if you were unaware of those facts¬†\n\n\nIgnorance isn't bad on its own. Just when ignorant people insist on giving their opinions on topics they can't bother themselves to be basically informed about",
  "I think the general consensus is that the past 5-6ish games we have looked ‚Äúflat.‚Äù I do agree to an extent cuz we have been starting slow and not shooting as well, but we are STILL on a 13 game win streak. I love that we are at a point that winning games ‚Äútoo closely‚Äù is starting to become an issue with some, shows how great we can be",
  "I think to start, KA will start Strus to get him loose, but end games with Hunter.",
  "There gooeeesss myyyy heeerrro",
  "That‚Äôs a great way to say it. The Cavs are slumping while also winning, which is actually impressive.",
  "This guy:\n\n![gif](giphy|fRda6IRIGDESdVuYxE)",
  "When you‚Äôre 53-10 and have the best record in the entire NBA, it‚Äôs tough keeping the underdog label. Charlotte wanted that game last night, they suck this season but they were selling out the last quarter to get a W. If they were playing almost any other team besides maybe OKC or Boston i doubt they would of shown the same energy",
  "Only thing I‚Äôll add to that is the 5 second closely-guarded rule needs to be strictly enforced (is it even a rule in the NBA right now?) otherwise offensive players will just turtle up",
  "I'm thrilled!\n\nAre people unhappy??!",
  "Yes it's crazy to think that the Cavs are in a bit of a slump while having a 13 game win streak. ü§Ø",
  "This should be first on Silver‚Äôs list to fix.  Instead he‚Äôll make another 10 tweaks to try to save all star weekend ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
  "Eric Collins is probably the best commentator in the NBA. It‚Äôs a shame his prime is being wasted by the Hornets.",
  "You know what being done means? Not responding. You don't seem to understand that your words don't actually match your actions and then act surprised when people don't believe what you say",
  "Technically yes, but I wouldn‚Äôt wanna overly exert the team fishing for that. I get that we would have a few extra days off, play in tournament, but I rather keep the mins the same to keep them fresh for the long term",
  "Okay I‚Äôm still gunna leave it but I love your last line, the irony of you assuming you know me and the context of this conversation is fantastic. Lmao",
  "You said people were just assuming Bridges committed domestic abuse. Some of us inform ourselves on the topic before we speak and didn't have to assume because we¬†knew he already admitted in court he assaulted a woman¬†\n\n\nAs it pertains to securing a criminal conviction, his previous abuse may be inadmissible. But as¬†it pertains to cheering for him, it's irrelevant if he \"only\" abused one woman. That's one more than is acceptable. And now maybe that you're aware he's an admitted abuser, you'll go and defend someone who deserves it. But I highly doubt it",
  "explain why the kid said that then",
  "Strange as it is, Cavs are in a lull despite having a 13 game win streak. Glass half full perspective is that all these close games require a lot of strategy and execution which will help in the playoffs.",
  "I refuse to admit I am wrong because you are accusing me of things I never said, and in doing so continue to move the goal posts. \n\nWhat I have said so far: defendants are innocent until proven guilty.\n\nWhat you have accused me of: cheering for Bridges, defending domestic abuse, encouraging immoral behavior, etc.\n\nSo, maybe spelling it out like that you will understand. (I doubt it) but I‚Äôm done here lol",
  "Small sample size dude.  The other team has to make their free throws too.  The two times you‚Äôre mentioning‚Ä¶ the Cavs won.",
  "Right no two games with some in between is not five straight. They were also missing some people, remember?"
